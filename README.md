Motivation

  The motivation for the project (this should be a bit more detail -- why was this project chosen?)
  
  The project is part of the Udacity course Data Science Nanodegree. The dataset was choosen due to the curiosity to understand the shared bikes dynamic as the author has been using it  for a while.

Files
---------
  blog_regression.ipynb - jupyter notebook containing the analysis
  
  hour.csv - csv file containing the data sampled hourly
  
  bikes_day.csv - csv file containing the data sampled daily
  
Summary
---------
1. Data exploration and explotatory analysis
2. Showing that temperature affects bike renting daily and working day the hourly data
3. Two models that predicted the amount of bikes daily and hourly
